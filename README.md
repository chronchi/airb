# An (opinionated) introduction to R for biologists

This book covers some R principles that are necessary, in my opinion,
to start analysing your own data. The book can be accessed in the 
following link.

## What is data? 

Data here is meant to be qPCR data or some longitudinal data. To fully explore
your own work, I recommend using R. It gives you flexibility and 
forces you to think on the best way to analyse the data.

## What will I learn? 

You will learn in the context of biological data how to use 
the tidyverse, ggplot2 and linear models. These are essential tools
in order to analyse your data and fully explore it. 

## Can I try something else? 

Sure! This is my opinion on how R could be used to analyse biological data,
such as qPCR or longitudinal. I hope during the book I can convince you 
that these are good tools and you would love to try them out!


## Questions? 

Please, do ask them! If you have any question, feel free to open an issue
on github or send me an email at carlos.ronchi@epfl.ch. I **strongly**
recommend to raise issues instead of sending emails. This way your peers
can peek at the question and they might help you as well.

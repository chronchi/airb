# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to An (opinionated) introduction to R for biologists! In this 
short book we will show you how to use the basics of R and the 
tidyverse to analyse your qPCR. We will go over data manipulation,
plotting and statistical analysis, all in a context of qPCR data.

Since this book is just a brief introduction with a focus on R, to
learn more in general check the book 
[Hands-On Programming with R](https://jjallaire.github.io/hopr/).
Now, if you are familiar with R already, but want to learn 
new tricks and usefull tools, check the book
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). The authors
go over the data science tasks, some of the mentioned in this
book, while going deeper into the functions mentioned here.

# Preparing the data

> Describe data needs to be in special format to do stuff in R, explain
pivoting. Explain groupping as well, which makes it easier to do 
average calculations

## Loading libraries and files

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

qpcr <- readRDS("../checkpoints/cleaning/qpcr.rds")
```

## Pivoting 

> explain pivoting and why it is useful. mention plotting and filtering

## Grouping data

> explain the use of group_by from dplyr. show how useful it is by summarizing
and filtering based on groups.

## Checkpoint

> save summarized data and pivotted data.

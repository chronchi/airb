# Generating a report

Usually an analysis is done multiple times, so it is important we 
document what we did. We might come back in the future to add 
some more data points or we just want to know what happened when
the analysis was performed. 

Quarto markdown is a way to do so. By using quarto markdown you can mix
both code and text together, so your analysis can be documented and 
reused in the future. As a matter of fact, this book was done in
quarto. 

The Posit team (Rstudio and
tidyverse developers) have written amazing tutorials on how to use quarto
markdown and author documents. The link below leads to a get started

Essentially the idea is that you need to know a bit of R and a bit of
markdown. Markdown is an intuitive way of writing text. The paradigm is 
a bit different than that of Microsoft Word as you need to render your
documents to get the final output.

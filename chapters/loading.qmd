# Loading your data

The first step in any data analysis is to open up your favorite 
software and load the data up. You are probably familiar with user interfaces,
where you click some buttons, you upload your excel file and *voil√°*, data
is ready to analyse. 

In this chapter I will teach you how to format your qPCR data so you
can load it easily to R. I will also show you how to load the data itself.

If you are using RStudio, you can also click some buttons and load your 
data, without writing any code. I strongly recommend you to **not** do 
this. In the next sections I will show how you should be doing.

## Formats, formats and more formats...

If you are here, you are probably used to excel and the format xlsx. This 
is a proprietary format, that you either use Excel or another open source
alternative to open. R can open these files, however, it is easier to run
your analysis if you have your data in the *csv* format.
